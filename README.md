jstars-keep-hover
=================

A version of jStars that you can use on elements with :hover

The normal jStars creates a span element next to the cursor that interupts :hover.  This places the span inside the element (using :hover) so the :hover still gets applied.

Please note; the element must have a position (not static) set.
